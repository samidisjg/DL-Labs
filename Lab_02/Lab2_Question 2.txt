Question 2

Patterns of accuracy, when hidden nodes increase,

1.) Accuracy is increasing

2)
1.Low neurons = Underfitting (Accuracy low)
2.Moderate neurons = best fir (Accuracy high and stable)
3.Too many neurons = overfitting risk (Accuracy on training stays high, but generalization may drop)
